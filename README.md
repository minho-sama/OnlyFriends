## onlyfriends
A project made with Node/Express, EJS, and CSS/SASS to practice PassportJS. <br>
You can sign up and create messages after typing the correct password in to become a member. As an admin, you're able to retrieve data about other users, as well as deleting any messages (actually deleting other people's messages is protected by an extra password to protect my database, as anyone can be an admin). <br>
#### password for membership: **vanillamilkshake**
#### to become admin: **cheeseburger**
